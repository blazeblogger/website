<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>

<p>Additionally, this update also fixes the following bugs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Previously, the RSS feed produced by BlazeBlogger did not contain the
    “encoding” attribute. Consequent to this, the feed may have been
    rendered incorrectly when the blog used a different code page than the
    default UTF-8. With this release, the RSS feed has been extended, and
    the XML header now defines the character encoding as expected.
  </li>
  <li>
    Previously, blog post and page headers contained a grave accent (that
    is, <code>`</code>), which may have caused the syntax highlighting to
    be rendered incorrectly in certain text editors. This has been fixed,
    and the grace accent has been replaced with an apostrophe (that is,
    <code>'</code>).
  </li>
</ul>
