<h3>Features</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Added command wrapper, so that utilities can now be invoked using
    both <code>blaze-init</code> and more usual <code>blaze
    init</code>.</li>
  <li>Added <code>&lt;!-- posts --&gt;</code> placeholder to make it possible to
    list recent posts.</li>
  <li>Added <code>&lt;!-- page-title --&gt;</code> placeholder to be used
    inside TITLE element.</li>
  <li>Added <code>--stats</code> command-line option to
    <em>blaze-list</em> so that it shows repository statistics instead of
    posts/pages.</li>
  <li>Added basic colour support to <em>blaze-log</em> and
    <em>blaze-list</em> utilities. If <code>color.log</code> and
    <code>color.list</code> options are set to <code>true</code> (or
    <code>auto</code> in case you are too used to Git), both repository log
    and posts/pages listing should now be displayed in fancy colours. Note
    that you can always override the current settings with
    <code>--color</code> (or <code>--no-color</code>) command-line
    option.</li>
  <li>Added further verbosity level to <em>blaze-init</em> utility. It is
    now capable of displaying list of created files when requested.</li>
  <li>Made it possible to remove multiple records at once.</li>
  <li>Added further CSS classes for more flexible theme creation.</li>
  <li>Simplified theme and stylesheet creation description.</li>
  <li>Significantly extended introductory tutorial.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Changed generating order of <em>blaze-make</em> utility, so that even
    corrupted pages look the way they should.</li>
  <li>Fixed tags creation, making them properly converted to lower case as
    they should be.</li>
  <li>Fixed duplicate tags handling.</li>
  <li>Fixed colon handling in header data.</li>
  <li>Fixed RSS feed creation. There is no need to include the index file
    name itself to the post link, especially when its extension is optional
    and therefore every change may result in confusion of some RSS
    readers.</li>
  <li>Optimized <em>blaze-add</em> utility.</li>
  <li>Unified the look of created files' paths listing of
    <em>blaze-make</em>.</li>
  <li>Corrected several typing errors.</li>
</ul>
