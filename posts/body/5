<p>BlazeBlogger 0.8.0 has been finally released! Among few minor usability
improvements, the most significant change from the last release candidate
is the newly gained independence on any additional Perl
modules.</p>

<h3><a name="features"></a>Features</h3>

<ul>
  <li>BlazeBlogger now depends on core libraries only, no longer
    requiring the <code>Config::IniHash</code> module.</li>
  <li>Running <code>blaze-remove</code> with <code>--interactive</code> (or
    just <code>-i</code>) makes it ask for confirmation before the actual
    removal, making it less easy to accidentally remove wrong
    post/page.</li>
  <li>In the configuration, it is now possible to specify the external text
    editor along with its command-line options, e.g. <code>gvim
    -f</code>.</li>
</ul>
