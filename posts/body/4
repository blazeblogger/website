<p>BlazeBlogger 0.8.0 RC2 has been released! Unfortunately, there was much
more to fix than I anticipated when I published the first release candidate
a week ago, and since the final release of 0.8.0 is going to stay for a
while, I decided to publish the second release candidate to make sure I did
not miss anything this time. Complete list of changes follows.</p>

<h3><a name="features"></a>Features</h3>

<ul>
  <li><code>blaze-make</code> now generates the index page for
    <code>/tags</code> directory as well. This should have been implemented
    long time ago, but somehow I forgot and managed not to even
    notice.</li>
  <li><code>&lt;!--&nbsp;root&nbsp;--&gt;</code> placeholder has been
    renamed to more appropriate <code>&#0037;root&#0037;</code>, although
    old variant will be still supported, at least to the next release (for
    the compatibility reasons). It can also newly appear in the page/post
    body to make it easier to link images, videos and other files.</li>
  <li><code>blaze-make</code> no longer recognizes the <code>--force</code>
    option and the CSS file is now always rewritten, unless told otherwise
    via the <code>--no-css</code> option. The old solution was simply too
    obscure and unexpected to be worth it.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="bugfixes"></a>Bug Fixes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Corrected several inaccuracies in manual pages and updated them
    according to changes above.</li>
  <li>RSS feed now includes <code>pubDate</code> element, because some
    readers were confused without it. Once again, this should have been
    there right from the beginning, but somehow nobody felt the urge to
    tell me.</li>
</ul>
