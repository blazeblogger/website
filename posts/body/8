<p>BlazeBlogger 0.9.1 has been released! Among several bug fixes and
various usability improvements, the most significant change is the
introduction of placeholders for easier cross-referencing and possibility
to change the exact location of each of the post information; see a
complete list of changes below.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Added <code>&#0037;post[<em>id</em>]&#0037;</code> and
    <code>&#0037;page[<em>id</em>]&#0037;</code> placeholders, making it
    possible to safely refer to the post or page with given
    <em>id</em>, no matter what URL it currently has.</li>
  <li>Added <code>--number</code> and <code>--reverse</code> command-line
    options to <em>blaze-list</em> and <em>blaze-log</em> utilities. This
    is mainly to make log and posts/pages browsing more flexible and less
    dependent on additional Unix utilities such as <code>head</code> or
    <code>tail</code> at the same time.</li>
  <li>Made location of post information optional. You can now set the
    location of post author, date of publishing, and tags by changing the
    value of <code>post.author</code>, <code>post.date</code>, and
    <code>post.tags</code> options respectively.</li>
  <li>Added <code>post-footer</code> class to the style sheet.</li>
  <li>Improved RSS feed creation, so that the produced output is much
    cleaner.</li>
  <li>Extended documentation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Trailing spaces in post/page title are now properly cut and no longer
    result in superfluous dashes in URL.</li>
  <li>Missing or invalid header data are being repaired more thoroughly and
    appropriate warning message, describing what is wrong and how exactly
    was the problem solved, is displayed.</li>
  <li>Pages with foreign diacritical marks can no longer end up with empty
    URL. Instead, the URL is based on the page ID and user is warned.</li>
  <li>Similarly to pages, tags with foreign diacritical marks can no longer
    end up with empty URL as well. Instead, the MD5 hash is used instead
    and user is, once again, warned.</li>
  <li>Both post/page author and assigned tags can safely contain colon
    mark.</li>
  <li>Language file contains &lsquo;posted on&rsquo; string.</li>
</ul>
