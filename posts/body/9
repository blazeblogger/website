<p>BlazeBlogger 1.0.0 has been finally released! The most significant
change from the latest release is probably the addition of
<code>core.processor</code> configuration option making it possible to use
whatever markup language user wishes, as well as introduction of bash
completion and quick reference card; see a complete list of changes
below.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Added <code>core.processor</code> configuration option, making it
    possible to specify an external application or applications to be used
    to process the entries. Thanks to this feature, the usage of whatever
    markup language suites people the best is now simply matter of a single
    configuration option.</li>
  <li>Added <code>&#0037;tag[<em>name</em>]&#0037;</code> placeholder,
    making it always return valid relative path to the tag with given
    <em>name</em>.</li>
  <li>Distinguished repository creation from its recovery.</li>
  <li>Avoided rewriting existing stylesheet when it is exactly the same as
    the original; patch by Matthew Woehlke.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>

<ul>
  <li><em>blaze-config</em> now displays proper default value even though
    the requested option is not actually found in the configuration
    file.</li>
  <li>Temporary files are now removed once they are not needed any
    more.</li>
  <li>Added version information to manual pages.</li>
</ul>
